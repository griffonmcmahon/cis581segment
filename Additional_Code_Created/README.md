## These Additional Files were created in order for the final code products to perform correctly

#### Training_Segmentation_Code.ipynb
*  This file was the file used to generate our model using Detectron2

#### Image_formatter_for_training.py
* This file was used to convert the annotated data from the bdd dataset to the coco format.  This was a required step as Detectron needs data in coco format to train on.
* This code utilized pre-existing code from: https://github.com/chrise96/image-to-coco-json-converter
* The pre-existing code from the above source was modified in order for it to work in our project
